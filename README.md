# SudokuSolver
This Python code can solve easy and medium-level sudoku puzzles. It doesn't work for harder levels. I'll need to sit and write the code for that sometime...

For this solver, all you need to do is provide a CSV file that has the puzzle. The file should have numbers as they are listed in the sudoku puzzle.

For example, for the following puzzle

![git](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105305765/196004777-2a6c82bf-7337-45ef-a41d-9a2b24196ea1.PNG)

the CSV should look like

![gitin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105305765/196004826-29c62b53-a891-4e7e-99f6-0da1c31dbd70.PNG)


You can tweak the variable itnum in the code. If a certain value doesn't fully solve the puzzle, increase the value until it does!
Usually, a value of 5 or 6 should be fine for easy and medium-level puzzles.
